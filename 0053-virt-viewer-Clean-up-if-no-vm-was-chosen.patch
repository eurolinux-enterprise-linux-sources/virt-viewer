Subject: [PATCH] virt-viewer: Clean up if no vm was chosen

It is safe to clean up when running virt-viewer without specifying
vm name if no vm was chosen. It brings back behavior before 88f6341.

The 'if (dom == NULL && err != NULL)' part was affected by commits
824c4b9, 1eaaf8c, 15c7d17 so the check for 'err' is not needed anymore.

(cherry picked from commit 66afac53b6769f079d537cfa130f212286981c93)
